# Codex Project Portfolio

A curated portfolio of application prototypes built **entirely using Codex** (OpenAIâ€™s code generation model). This project showcases how Codex can rapidly create interactive prototypes, web apps, and creative experiments with minimal manual coding.

## ðŸš€ Overview

- **Purpose**: Explore and demonstrate the capabilities of Codex for end-to-end prototyping.  
- **Contents**: Each prototype highlights a unique use case â€” from games to planners, visual demos, and beyond.  
- **Audience**: Developers, designers, and AI enthusiasts interested in AI-assisted coding workflows.

## ðŸ§  How It Was Built

1. **Prompt-driven development**  
   Each prototype begins with a carefully crafted natural language prompt describing the appâ€™s goals, UI, and interactivity.

2. **Codex generation**  
   Codex generates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript snippets or entire files, which are refined and tested iteratively.

3. **Testing & iteration**  
   Prototypes are run in the browser, with refinements guided by additional Codex prompts and manual tweaks.

4. **Polishing**  
   Styles, responsiveness, and usability are adjusted to bring prototypes closer to production-ready quality.
